### Question

> Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

```
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

### Code [C++]

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        vector<int> dict(256, -1);
        int maxLen = 0, start = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i != s.length(); i++) {
            if (dict[s[i]] > start)
                start = dict[s[i]];
            dict[s[i]] = i;
            maxLen = max(maxLen, i - start);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
};
```
